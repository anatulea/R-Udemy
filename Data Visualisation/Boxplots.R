# Boxplots with ggplot2Â¶
# Boxplots are convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data 
# through their quartiles. Box plots may also have lines extending vertically from 
# the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles,
# hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be 
# plotted as individual points.
